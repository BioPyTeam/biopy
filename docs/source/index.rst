This doc is meant to be a user guide on the use of the proposed 'biopy' package.
Therefore it will focus more on the code structure and purposes, taking for granted
that the reader knows about the tasks and the setting of the problems tackled.

For a more in-depth explanation and the motivations of the choices refer to the presentation.
